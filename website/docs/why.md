# Why basi?

I created basi because I wanted a simpler language/syntax to author End-to-End  tests for testing web applications. Don't get me wrong, JavaScript is nice and all but I thought a simpler language could help reduce the burden and hopefully be used to involve non-programmers in the process.

It's still got a bit of work to be a V1 but it works well enough for simple automation checks and can be included in CI pipelines to perform End-to-End UI tests for web.

There is so much to be done and so much to improve the project, feel free to contribute or sponsor the work.
